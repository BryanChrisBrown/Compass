# Compass for Northstar

Compass is your one-stop-shop for setting up your Northstar device(s)! With an intuitive and rather sexy UI, setting up calibrations, installing drivers, and launching software *(coming soon!)* is a breeze.

## Compatability

As Northstar is a modular and open source platform, there are many variations of the headset in circulation. Currently we support visual calibration for all devices that conform to the Northstar 3.1 release and that can be calibrated via the methods found in the docs. For sensor calibration, the Intel Realsense t265 and the Leap Motion Controller are currently supported
